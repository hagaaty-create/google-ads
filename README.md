## Pushing to GitHub

### For the first time or if you have problems

If you are facing "Repository not found" error, run these commands in order.

1. Remove the old remote link:
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

2. Add the correct remote link:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/hagaaty-create/google-ads.git
```

3. Set the main branch:
```bash
git branch -M main
```

4. Push your code:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### For future updates

After the first successful push, you only need these commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "A short description of my changes"
git push origin main
```
