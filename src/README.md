# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Pushing to GitHub

Here are the commands to push your code to your GitHub repository from your command line (CMD):

1.  **Initialize Git in your project directory (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    ```

2.  **Add all your project files to be tracked:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Create a commit to save your changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit of the project"
    ```

4.  **Connect your local project to your GitHub repository:**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/hagaaty-create/google-ads.git
    ```

5.  **Push your code to the `main` branch on GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

After running these commands, your code will be available on your GitHub repository.
